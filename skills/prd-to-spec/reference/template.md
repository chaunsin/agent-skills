## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 System Context
[Where this feature fits in the overall system — diagram or description]

### 2.2 Component Design
[New components/modules introduced, their responsibilities, and boundaries]

### 2.3 Module Interactions
[How new components interact with existing ones — sequence or data flow]

### 2.4 File Structure
[Present and indicate the file status (newly added, deleted, or modified) using a directory tree approach.]

---

## 3. Data Model

### 3.1 Schema Changes
[New tables, columns, indexes — with SQL or ORM notation]

### 3.2 Entity Definitions
[TypeScript interfaces / Go structs / Python dataclasses for new entities]

[Known edge cases and how they should be handled]

---

## 6. Error Handling

### 6.1 Error Taxonomy
| Error Code | HTTP Status | Condition | User Message |
|------------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### 8.1 Expected Load
[Estimated QPS, data volume, growth projection]

### 8.2 Optimization Strategy
[Caching, pagination, lazy loading, batch processing]

### 8.3 Database Considerations
[Index strategy, query patterns, N+1 prevention]

---

## 9. Testing Strategy

### 9.1 Unit Tests
[What to test, test boundaries, mock strategy]

### 9.2 Integration Tests
[API tests, database tests, service interaction tests]

### 9.3 Edge Case Tests
[Specific scenarios to cover based on Section 5.4]
